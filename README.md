## Notes

Learning a new language is always a fun, challenging adventure. However, Kotlin is an easy-to-learn programming language, and I had no problems understanding it. However, Android Studio has a multitude of features, and I got sometimes lost. It was pretty hard to implement complex activities into the screen, thus why I used an empty activity for all my pages. Overall, it was a fun endeavour, and I am sure I can accomplish much more through practice.

The "Roll-the-Dice" app feature is a modified version of a [Kotlin Basics](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-four) class I've done to obtain more knowledge about Android Studio and develop a more thoughtful app for CodePath.
